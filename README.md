# `websnapse-core`

WebSnapse is a web simulation tool for Spiking Neural P (SN P) systems. It's had a rich history over the past couple of years, which I drew up in [this Jamboard file](https://jamboard.google.com/d/18fGQR_r_HbXuWYxwzf07Aqd6nfJDIsEYFRig8E9XsMg/edit?usp=sharing).

The project is in a stage where emphasizing UI, UX, and DX becomes paramount, and my plan is to get the best of all worlds. **WebSnapse Core** is the amalgamation of features, fixes, and reboots the current generation of WebSnapse projects are putting on the table.
